![ambassadorts.png](Joystream%20-%20Ambassador%20Program%20Plan%20v1%201fc821a095144a848646c8d4c42bdab3/ambassadorts.png)

# Intro

As the [Founding Member Program](https://github.com/Joystream/founding-members/tree/main) concludes its impactful chapter – initially initiated and managed by JSGenesis – the Ambassador Program is envisioned as a forthcoming DAO initiative, carrying forward the essence of community-driven engagement and a sense of belonging. It aims to establish a seamless continuation and enhancement of the initiatives instigated by JSGenesis in the FM Program. The Ambassador Program, when implemented, will deliberately emphasize attracting creative individuals focused on amplifying awareness of the Joystream protocol. The aim is to cultivate a decentralized environment where the community actively contributes to and influences the platform's growth and success.

# Goals

The primary focus of the Ambassador Program is to strategically amplify awareness of the Joystream protocol. While promoting community-driven engagement and contributing to the broader advancement of Joystream remain important, the paramount objective is to enhance the platform's visibility across diverse channels.

## **Primary Objectives**

1. **Amplify Awareness of the Joystream Protocol**
    - Elevate the visibility of Joystream across diverse channels, ensuring a broader reach.
    - Harness the creativity of ambassadors to communicate the platform's features and advantages effectively.
2. **Community-Driven Engagement**
    - Cultivate a sense of belonging and active participation within the Joystream community.
    - Encourage ambassadors to initiate discussions, events, and collaborations that foster meaningful interactions.
3. **Drive Decentralized Growth and Success**
    - Empower community leaders and influencers to spearhead Joystream's decentralized expansion, promoting the adoption of new dApps and cultivating strategic partnerships.
    - Utilize the Ambassador Program to catalyze a distributed network effect, driving organic growth and amplifying awareness about innovative developments, partnerships, and community-driven initiatives.

## **Alignment**

1. **Align with Broader Marketing and Community Growth Goals**
    - Ensure that the Ambassador Program functions as a strategic arm of the overarching marketing strategy.
    - Collaborate with existing community growth initiatives to amplify the impact of both programs synergistically.
2. **Strengthen the Community's Influence on Platform Evolution**
    - Enable ambassadors to contribute to the platform's evolution by acting as conduits for user feedback and suggestions.
    - Empower ambassadors to actively participate in Joystream governance, representing the community's perspectives and influencing strategic decisions for Joystream's development.

## **Strategic Impact**

The Ambassador Program propels Joystream to new heights through increased recognition and engagement, acting as a catalyst for awareness within the ecosystem.

# **Target Audience**

Understanding our community is crucial for the success of the Joystream Ambassador Program. Exploring specific user personas helps Joystream connect with users who align seamlessly with the platform's values and goals, attracting new and like-minded participants.

## **Primary Audience**

- **Creative Individuals Enthusiastic about Blockchain and Decentralized Platforms**
    - This group comprises artists, designers, and creators excited about exploring the possibilities of blockchain technology.
    - Their interest lies in leveraging decentralized platforms for creative expression and collaboration.
- **Current and Potential Joystream Community Members**
    - The Ambassador Program seeks to reinforce connections within the current community and attract new users to join Joystream.
    - Engaging existing members taps into their enthusiasm, extending the platform's reach and impact.

## **User Personas**

Ambassador program v1 launch:

- ***Content Creators**:* Ambassadors in this category include YouTubers, podcasters, bloggers, and other content creators. Their role is to generate engaging content about Joystream, showcasing its features and potential.
- ***Influencers**:* Individuals with a significant following on social media platforms. They have the power to influence and shape opinions within their communities.

Ambassador program v2 launch: (optional)

- ***Community Leaders**:* Ambassadors who take on leadership roles within localized Joystream communities.
- ***Educators***: Ambassadors with a focus on educating the community about Joystream functionalities and benefits.
- ***Developers***: Ambassadors with technical expertise, contributing to the development and improvement of Joystream ecosystem.

## **Ideal Candidate and Program Scale**

The ambassador program is designed to focus on quality over quantity for its initial launch. We aim to invite a select group of **ten ambassadors**, ensuring a focused and impactful beta test. If we find more highly qualified candidates, there is flexibility to consider expanding beyond ten.

## Key Qualities to look for

- Strong online presence
- Content creation skills
- In-depth understanding of Joystream and Web3
- A passion to share their knowledge
- Genuine authenticity

## Requirements

To ensure Joystream selects the most suitable candidates while providing opportunities for channels with fewer subscribers or followers to demonstrate their potential, the following criteria have been established for selection into the ambassador program:

**Twitter / X.COM**

• Account must be verified with a blue tick on the users profile 
• Account must be at least 3 months old 
• Must have a profile picture 
• Have at least 3,000 followers 
• Consistent posting schedule with at least 10 tweets per month

**YouTube**

• Channel should be at least 3 months old 
• Have at least 500 subscribers 
• Consistent posting schedule with at least two videos per month

**Other Platforms (e.g. TikTok, personal blog, podcast)**

• Channel should be at least 3 months old
• Consistent posting schedule with at least two content per month

*Candidates must satisfy the requirements for at least one of the two platforms – YouTube or Twitter – if they are active on both.*

## Candidate Video

As part of the application process, candidates must submit a 1 to 3-minute video introducing themselves and explaining why they are a good fit for the Joystream Ambassador Program. This video submission is a strategic step to boost the authenticity of applications and reduce the risk of fraudulent submissions.

# **Program Structure**

The Ambassador Program boasts a structured framework designed to provide clarity and guidance to its participants, ensuring a seamless experience aligned with the goals of Joystream.

## ****Incentives****

The success of the Ambassador Program depends on the incentives provided to ambassadors. Joystream offers a comprehensive set of incentives that go beyond just monetary rewards. This approach ensures ambassadors are not only motivated financially but also deeply involved in the Joystream ecosystem.

- **Monetary**
    - The most attractive offers for ambassadors will be the money paid to them. There are two options that can be done here, either reward users in USDT or through the JOY token. **It is recommended to do the latter**, as using the JOY token will allow these ambassadors to be more bought into the ecosystem. The fixed amount paid per month to each ambassador will vary depending on the tier that they are in, allowing the ambassadors who work the hardest to be rewarded.
    - Monetary rewards are subject to change and agreed upon with the council. We might consider increasing rewards and applying a vesting schedule of 24 months or making vesting optional.
        - Tier 1: 4,000 JOY per month
        - Tier 2: 6,000 JOY per month
        - Tier 3: 8,000 JOY per month
        - Tier 4: 10,000 JOY per month
- **Early access to new developments**
    - Joystream ambassadors will be granted exclusive early access to upcoming features, services, and products. This approach will allow for conducting pre-release product testing with actual users. This will also enable our ambassadors to craft and prepare content in advance.
- **Direct contact with founders and/or core DAO team through monthly meet-ups**
    - Give ambassadors the opportunity for a monthly AMA session with the main team behind Joystream. This will help the ambassadors feel like they are more part of the organization and will also allow them to ask any necessary questions that they may have to create valuable content.
    - Access to a private group (Discord server, Telegram chat) for Ambassadors.
    - Invite ambassadors to participate in Twitter Spaces and other important community meetings to enhance their connection with the Joystream community.
- **Exclusive Space on [Joystream.org](http://joystream.org/) (optional):**
    - A dedicated section will be created on Joystream.org landing page or the upcoming Joystream dashboard. This section will display their avatars, tiers, and induction dates.
    - Provide ambassadors with a sense of having a special seat within the organization.
    - This will enhance the credibility of the program and the ambassadors themselves.
- **Joystream Apparel**
    - Offer ambassadors a variety of apparel and merchandise with the Joystream branding on them. This will be especially valuable for YouTubers as we can encourage them to wear it in their videos for extra visibility.
    - Offer ambassadors Joystream branded hardware wallets (e.g. OneKey, Tangem)
- **Promotion of channel through Joystream marketing activities**
    - Ambassadors and their channels will be promoted throughout the social channels of Joystream. We can promote the different content that they produce to highlight the strength of the ambassador program.
    - Compile lists of high-quality channels managed by Joystream ambassadors and recommend featuring their channels to Joystream gateway operators.
    - Compile lists of high-quality NFTs minted by Joystream ambassadors and recommend featuring these NFTs to Joystream gateway operators.
- **Unique Discord and on-chain roles**
    - Grant the `Joystream Ambassador` Discord role and `verified` on-chain status through registration with the backend for ambassadors who reach Tier 4.
- **Raffles/Bounties (optional)**
    - To boost morale among the ambassador community, we can explore the introduction of a raffle system. This system would allow ambassadors to win a range of prizes and complete exclusive bounties designed specifically for them.
    - So ambassadors have the option to earn additional funds, we can offer high-value tasks that users can complete to earn a bonus on top of the fixed monthly payments. These tasks can vary in value, with the ones benefiting Joystream the most, being rewarded the most.
- **Avatar**
    
    ![https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1041358736243052689/1184410291228917860/avatars__1.png?ex=658bdf0a&is=65796a0a&hm=e6b81126ac07af3bc243c954a7942119bccfd3d06596377a834fc5b95efbecf4&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1920&height=207](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1041358736243052689/1184410291228917860/avatars__1.png?ex=658bdf0a&is=65796a0a&hm=e6b81126ac07af3bc243c954a7942119bccfd3d06596377a834fc5b95efbecf4&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1920&height=207)
    
    - Ambassadors reaching the Tier 4 status will receive a custom handmade avatar in the Founding Program style. They can then choose a unique avatar from a specially designed pack (30+ avatars) created by MWG exclusively for this program.
- **Recognition within the DAO**
    - In the future, the council will likely reward early contributors (Ambassadors) when Joystream succeeds, acknowledging their significant contributions to the project's success. This recognition may come in various forms, such as special mentions, exclusive privileges, or additional benefits within the Joystream DAO.

![onboarding.png](Joystream%20-%20Ambassador%20Program%20Plan%20v1%201fc821a095144a848646c8d4c42bdab3/onboarding.png)

# **Onboarding**

Approved applicants will go through the onboarding process, which will be executed by the MWG. 

- Email notification confirming acceptance
- Addition of the applicant to the Ambassadors Discord server
- Introduction to the Code of Conduct and Ambassador Guidelines
- Workflow introduction
- Tasks execution

****Code of Conduct for Joystream Ambassadors****

Joystream Ambassadors are expected to uphold a standard of behavior outlined in our Code of Conduct. This ensures a positive and respectful environment within our community, and this document will be crafted and maintained by the Marketing Working Group.

****Ambassador Guidelines****

Our Ambassador Guidelines will serve as a roadmap for effective engagement, providing insights into best practices. This will ensure ambassadors contribute meaningfully to Joystream's brand positioning, workflow, and content management. These guidelines will be developed and updated by the Marketing Working Group.

**Limiting Ambassadors**

Select up to 10 ambassadors initially to ensure exclusivity and facilitate a manageable assessment of the program's initial run.

# Management

**Clear guidelines for ambassadors**

- Create a detailed guideline document for ambassadors. This should cover expectations, roles, content creation standards, communication protocols, and any other important information.
- Ensure that these guidelines are easily accessible, possibly through a dedicated section on the Joystream website or a pinned document in the Ambassador Discord server.

**Appointing an ambassador manager (optional)**

- Designate a dedicated Ambassador Manager responsible for overseeing the program. It may be beneficial to have someone from the community team take up this role.
- The manager's responsibilities will include organizing monthly meetings, providing support and guidance to ambassadors, monitoring their progress, and being the point of contact for any queries or issues.

**Monitoring Content**

- Implement a system to track and confirm the regular creation of content by ambassadors. (Notion DB, Spreadsheet, Pioneer, etc)
- Encourage ambassadors to share their upcoming content plans or ideas, allowing for feedback and alignment with Joystream’s marketing strategies.

## Communication

Arrange monthly meetings involving the MWG lead, Ambassador Manager, active council (optional), and ambassadors. These meetings will focus on discussing progress, exchanging feedback, planning future content, and addressing any concerns. Ambassadors are also encouraged to share their content for better visibility and feedback.

*There are two options that can be taken when setting up communication channels for the ambassadors:*

1. **Option 1**: Create a private group within the existing Joystream Discord server. This will allow ambassadors to easily interact with the broader community while having a dedicated space for discussions and updates. 
2. **Option 2**: Establish a separate Discord server for ambassadors. This can provide a more focused environment, but may reduce interaction with the larger community. (Recommended)

## Monitoring and feedback

The performance of each ambassador will be regularly tracked and reviewed, focusing on their content creation, engagement metrics, and overall contribution to the community. This ongoing assessment will enable the provision of constructive feedback to the ambassadors, guiding them in areas where they can enhance their performance and better align with the program's objectives.

A record of the tasks completed by ambassadors and the corresponding rewards will be maintained. This includes tracking whether rewards are distributed in the form of JOY tokens, XP points, or other incentives.

## **Ambassador Ranking System**

There will be a total of four ranks users can gain, with each rank requiring more XP to increase

### Tiers

- 🥉 **Bronze** - Tier 1
- 🥈 **Silver** - Tier 2
- 🥇 **Gold** - Tier 3
- 💎 **Diamond** - Tier 4

| Bronze | Silver | Gold | Diamond |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 XP | 250 XP | 500 XP | 1000 XP |

Alternatively, to avoid any confusion with YPP tiers:

- **🌱** **Neophytis** (The Novice) - Tier 1
- 🌟 **Daedalus** (The Ingenious) - Tier 2
- 💎 **Pollux** (The Luminary Leader) - Tier 3
- 👑 **Theios** (The Divine One) - Tier 4

### **Scoring System**

- **Criteria**
    - Tangible impact, creativity, technical contributions.
    - Effort, good faith, evidence provided.
- **Variable Scoring**
    - Points are based on relative utility, uniqueness, and effort.

### **Measurement and Reporting**

- **KPIs**
    - Social media reach
    - Content engagement
    - YPP referrals
- **Reporting Mechanisms**
    - Submission of monthly/termly summaries and evidence of contributions.

### **Review Mechanism**

Ambassador Program will undergo regular assessments conducted by the Marketing Working Group before each term ends. Ambassadors submitting reports can rank up by surpassing an XP threshold, unlocking higher tiers and rewards. Inactivity may result in XP deductions.

1. **Termly Evaluations**
    - MWG conducts termly evaluations of ambassador performance.
    - Criteria include content quality, engagement levels, and adherence to guidelines.
    - Key performance indicators (KPIs) reviewed include social media reach, new user referrals, and on-chain contributions.
    - Feedback gathered from the Ambassador Manager and fellow ambassadors.
2. **Ranking and Progression**
    - At the term's start, all ambassador work is assessed and attached to the lead report.
    - Ambassadors reaching a higher XP threshold are ranked up at the beginning of the new term.
    - Ambassadors can progress to a higher tier only once per council term, limited to moving from tier 1 to tier 2.
3. **Consequences for Falling Short**
    - If an Ambassador fails to meet standards or exhibits reduced activity, the MWG may deduct XP based on judgment.
    - Consequently, the Ambassador may face a decrease in rank at the start of the next term.

### **Quarterly Program Evaluations**

Every quarter, the Joystream Ambassador Program will be thoroughly evaluated by the Marketing Working Group. This assessment will look at key performance indicators and ambassador contributions, providing valuable insights to ensure ongoing alignment with Joystream's objectives and goals.

1. **Program Evaluations**
    - Conduct in-depth quarterly assessments of the program's overall impact.
    - Analyze cumulative KPI trends and ambassador contributions.
    - Assess the effectiveness of incentive structures and make adjustments as needed.
    - The MWG is responsible for preparing a comprehensive quarterly report on the program's performance for presentation to the Council and the community.
2. **DAO-Guided Reviews**
    - Leverage Joystream governance for program reviews.
    - Integrate community input through DAO proposals for program adjustments, such as increasing the number of ambassadors, introducing new roles, and adjusting ambassador rewards.
    - Encourage ambassadors to actively participate in DAO discussions related to program modifications.

## Ambassador Tasks

The Marketing Working Group will create a variety of tasks that will allow us to direct users in the type of content that they create. **There will be two types of tasks that ambassadors can complete,** **XP or JOY rewarded tasks**. As mentioned earlier, the XP tasks will be used for general tasks and activities that we want the ambassadors to complete, while the JOY rewarded tasks will give users additional Joystream for tasks that really bring extra value to the Joystream ecosystem.

This system can also be gamified further by implementing limited-timed tasks that allow users to boost their XP for a certain period.
